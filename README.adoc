== Idea

=== Main Features

* Explore endless randomly generated areas in a dark surreal setting.
* Brave greater challenges for greater rewards.
* Manage a rag-tag group of survivors, develop each characters skills as they
are used.
* Meet new characters as your camp grows into a village.
* Carefully manage time and resources to make sure the village survives another
cycle.
* Collect potent artefacts and master powerful magic to increase the chances of
your survival.
* Characters will die, yet the village may still survive, will there rise
another brave -- or foolish -- enough to retrieve the lost gear before it is
gone forever?
* In this strange world, you are never at the top of the food chain.
