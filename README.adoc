:toc:

Project start date: 2022-12-30 13:12.

== Idea

=== Main Features
Subject to change unrecognisably as the project develops.

* Explore endless randomly generated areas in a dark surreal setting.
* Brave greater challenges for greater rewards.
* Manage a rag-tag group of survivors, develop each characters skills as they
are used.
* Meet new characters as your camp grows into a village.
* Carefully manage time and resources to make sure the village survives another
cycle.
* Collect potent artefacts and master powerful magic to increase the chances of
your survival.
* Characters will die, yet the village may still survive, will there rise
another brave -- or foolish -- enough to retrieve the lost gear before it is
gone forever?
* In this strange world, you are never at the top of the food chain.

Most technical design docs are link:gdd/[here].

== In Progress
=== v0.0.4-prototype_1 "Creatures Come Alive"
* Rudimentary mob behavior.
** [ ] Homing to player.
** [ ] Dealing damage.
* [ ] Rudimentary way for player to deal damage.

== TODO

=== v0.0.5-prototype_1
* [ ] Randomised mob spawning system (based on spawn tables and stat
derivations).
* [ ] Consider how the various mob stats should be configured. Prob will go with
an sqlite3 database, but consider other alternatives.
** Text config file(s)?
** Code config file(s) e.g. struct tables (yay retro C), macros, constexprs?
** Function overrides of pure-virtuals?
** Database?
* More...

=== v0.0.x-prototype_1
* Random level generation.
* Basic inventory system.
* Dynamic texture selection for wall segments at corners, intersections, etc.
* Creature navigation based on the A* algorithm.
* Etc.

=== v0.1.0-prototype_1
* TODO - define 0.1.0-prototype_1 feature requirements

== Done so far

=== v0.0.0-prototype_1 Basic Framework
* [x] Rudimentary rendering & frame-control framework.
** [x] Test level.
*** Some tiles to render.
*** A floor tile and a wall tile.
** [x] Rudimentary player character.
*** Basic navigation.
*** Can't walk through walls.

=== v0.0.1-prototype_1 Groundwork for Basic Map and Level Object System
* [x] Implement basic level map system.
** Creatures i.e. just the player atm.
** Structures i.e. floor, wall.

=== v0.0.2-prototype_1 Groundwork for Creature Control and Object Interactions
* [x] Implement a general creature control system.
* [x] Re-introduce terrain constraints on movement i.e. can't walk through walls
, but via the general creature control system this time.
* [x] Groundwork for level object interaction system.
* [x] Player control input handling via the creature control system.
* [x] Have an enemy critter on the test map, a static dummy (for now).

=== v0.0.3-prototype_1 "Dynamic Resource Loading and New Test Level"
* [x] A few test mobs.
* [x] Rudimentary creature stats (later to be used in combat and also useful
in spawning system for randomized stat derivation).
** Health points.
** Attack damage.
* [x] Basic fundamentals of a mob spawning system (spawn tables, etc).
* [x] Level tiles don't have to be unique, a reference to a type within a table
of loaded tile types should be enough and more resource friendly.
* [x] Improved test level and respective generation code.
** Should make it easy to test creature behaviour models, tile texture
adaptability, etc.
** Consider human-readability and future ease of quick iteration, modification.
